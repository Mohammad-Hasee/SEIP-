            <p><span>I am Mohammad Haseeb</span> but everyone calls me Hridoy. After graduating in Computer Science from
                Bangladesh University of Business and Technology, I completed a three month short course on web design at BITM. 
                My home is Mirpur. The house is in Shahjadpur of Sirajganj. I have one little brother and one sister. 
                I was big. I played a lot of sports in our field. I was the district champion in cricket. 
                I used to maintain cultural programs. I used to do tuition in Dhaka. If someone asks me for a task, 
                I listen carefully first and understand well what I have to do. I am a person who is positive in every aspect of life. 
                There are so many things I love to do, see and experience. I want to read.I was naughty from a very young age. 
                When I was 4, I learned Arabic from our village Nukali Hafizia Forkaniya Madrasa.
                BRAC education was prevalent in our village then. I take the chalk of Bengali education from there.
                Enrolled in Nukali Primary School. Then I found my first friend. His name is Jewel. That is my best friend. 
                There is a good new school in the village next to us. Both of us got admission to Hamid Aziz International School. 
                The first school day is memorable. My father took me to school. I was scared to see many people.
                Many people were busy taking pictures there. I also took the first picture from there. After that, 
                the best time of life is spent there. I get a watch for doing well in exams. Sir then promoted me one class higher. 
               <!---The headmaster of our school was a very good teacher. As good as anger. Everyone in the school was afraid of him. 
                Our school was one of the best in our area.After studying up to class 5, I went to Nukali Multilateral High School. 
                I used to dust a lot of games on the school grounds. Prabhat Feri, Victory Day, Independence Day, 
                and various other events were held in that field. Some of our friends along with our elders used to help 
                in conducting the event. Then he joined Shapla Kundi Kinder Garden to study. I studied there for a long time. 
                Moreover, another school was added to my life. It is sunrise academic school. Class 8. After doing good results 
                I have to stay in Shapla Kundi. Many friends have already become. Then our friends also performed a play 
                at the school function. -->Before the SSC exam, we became the district champion in cricket. Besides, 
                I won many prizes in village football sports. The college chapter starts after doing well in the SSC exam.
                An opportunity to study in the best college was created. <!--The name of our college was Alhera Academic School and College.
                I spent most of my time in college studying.--> Reading different types of novels, story books, history books, 
                and poetry books becomes a habit, as well as academic studies. I started liking the novels.
                A lot of books were left behind. <!--A good relationship developed with the teachers. After completing his, 
                I moved to Dhaka for the first time. Varsity life begins. A new chapter has begun after leaving behind many memories.
                Sports along with studies. Traveling with friends. I started burning Kisu students in Dhaka very quickly.
                Then the corona epidemic appeared in the whole world. Then the university went online. I went home. 
                I spent most of the time with my father. When the university opened, I returned to Dhaka.
                We all find rhythm in studies.  -->
